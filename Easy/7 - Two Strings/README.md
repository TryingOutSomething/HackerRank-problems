# [Two Strings](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/two-strings/problem?h_l=interview&playlist_slugs%5B%5D=interview-preparation-kit&playlist_slugs%5B%5D=dictionaries-hashmaps)

Given two strings, determine if they share a common substring. A substring may be as small as one character.

Example
s1 = 'and'
s2 = 'art'

These share the common substring a.

s1 = 'be'
s2 = 'cat'

These do not share a substring.
