Given an array of integers, calculate the fractions of its elements that are positive, negative, and are zeros. Print the decimal value of each fraction on a new line.

Note: This challenge introduces precision problems. The test cases are scaled to six decimal places, though answers with absolute error of up to **10<sup>-4</sup>** are acceptable.

For example, given the array **_arr_ = [1, 1, 0, -1, -1]** there are **5** elements, two positive, two negative and one zero. Their ratios would be **2/5 = 0.4000000**, **2/5 = 0.4000000** and **1/5 = 0.2000000**. It should be printed as 
```
0.400000
0.400000
0.200000
```
**Function Description**

Complete the plusMinus function in the editor below. It should print out the ratio of positive, negative and zero items in the array, each on a separate line rounded to six decimals.

plusMinus has the following parameter(s):

* arr: an array of integers
