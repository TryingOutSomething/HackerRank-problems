# [Insert a node at a specific position in a linked list](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/insert-a-node-at-a-specific-position-in-a-linked-list/problem?h_l=interview&playlist_slugs%5B%5D%5B%5D=interview-preparation-kit&playlist_slugs%5B%5D%5B%5D=linked-lists)

Given the pointer to the head node of a linked list and an integer to insert at a certain position, create a new node with the given integer as its data attribute, insert this node at the desired position and return the head node.

A position of 0 indicates head, a position of 1 indicates one node away from the head and so on. The head pointer given may be null meaning that the initial list is empty.

I did in _C_ first because the Java template had a compiled error. Once it was resolved, I wrote the Java version of the solution.
